# Visual_Search_of_an_Image_Collection
The first course work for CVPR 

## Introduction

## Tasks

### Some hints
1. They have already provide the code for Global colour historgram, which is just the request No.1, 30 points!
Be careful that the code somehow normalized the colour value twice!! Delete one if you want to use the code.
2. Skip the confusion matrix in request 2 if you don't understand, you can still get almost full mark if the PR curve is provided correctly along with explanation and analysis.
3.    For PR curve, please try to plot the graph for the whole graph(all 590 images),from (0,1) to (1,0), so its more clear and easy to understand, just like the one in the slides. You can identify the correct image by the name.
4.    If you have finished the basic requirements of the coursework, you can checkout the lab sheet for next week, which contains the code for SIFT (you can use for the bag of words). Bag of visual words is not that difficult, try to use he SIFT decriptor provided in the lab, it not hard to achieve this request and receive a full mark!
5.    When writing the report, for each function you implement, try to present the results of the several image search 3-5) along with the PR curve plot, remember to use the same images throughout the report, its easy to get higher mark!
6.    The SVM code provided for the lab is really difficult to apply in the coursework, if you really want to complete the last requirement, I recommand to use the codes provide online.


### How to estimate all the models
Just use one image to test all the models and use the precision of the results to estimate the models.
